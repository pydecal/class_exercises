# class_exercises
This repo will hold at least the first exercise for GitHub that I will do with the students on 09/05/2023. They will pull from this repo, copy the file they pull, and commit it. I will also show them how to make their own repos, and pull from and commit to those first bc then we don't have to deal with merge errors or authentication issues.
